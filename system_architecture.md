## 1. Idea Intake
Multi-step guided form helps founders describe their idea clearly.  
Collects problem statement, target users, value proposition, and goals.

## 2. NLP Parser
Extracts key assumptions from the founderâ€™s description.  
Classifies input by industry, stage, and validation readiness.

## 3. Validation Engine
Matches hypotheses against real startup datasets, market benchmarks, and common failure patterns.  
Generates measurable validation paths and 7-day experiment plans.

## 4. Benchmark Layer
Integrates comparative data (e.g., cost-to-acquire, conversion benchmarks).  
Includes transparency elements: source citation and confidence scoring.

## 5. Report Generator
Produces structured output: validation insights, MVP roadmap, and outreach templates.  
Delivers results instantly and stores for later comparison.

## Data Transparency & Trust Layer
Every insight includes:
- Source citation  
- Confidence level  
- Benchmark references
