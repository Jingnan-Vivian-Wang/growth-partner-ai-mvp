## 🧠 What It Does
Growth Partner AI acts as a **scientific companion for founders**, combining startup logic with AI reasoning.  
It helps entrepreneurs test assumptions, measure progress, and build investor-ready validation evidence, all within days.

**Five report modules:**
1. **Validation Report** – key demand signals and next steps  
2. **Competitor Report** – positioning and whitespace mapping  
3. **MVP Roadmap** – what to build first  
4. **Investor Report** – what proof investors want to see  
5. **Go-to-Market Plan** – turning validation into traction

## 🔧 Architecture Overview
```
User Input → NLP Parser → Validation Engine → Benchmark Layer → Report Generator
```

**Core Components**
- NLP Parser – interprets founder ideas and extracts hypotheses  
- Validation Engine – maps hypotheses to real startup data and failure cases  
- Benchmark Layer – adds comparative metrics and trust scores  
- Report Generator – produces structured, data-backed deliverables  

**Tech Stack**
- Frontend: Figma
- AI Layer: OpenAI API (prompt-driven analysis)  
- Data Layer: Curated startup benchmarks  
- Analytics: Mixpanel (planned integration)

## 📊 Research-Driven Design
Growth Partner AI was shaped through 14 founder interviews and 2 prototype tests.  

**Key Insights**
- Founders want actionable next steps, not theory.  
- Data transparency builds trust and willingness to pay.  
- Outreach friction is a major barrier — ready-made scripts reduce hesitation.  
- Guided inputs produce clearer, more useful reports.  

These findings directly informed the product UX and report logic.
